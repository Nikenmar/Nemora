 *
 * `any-ascii` is the general engine — a maintained Unicode-wide transliteration
 * table, which is what replaced hand-written per-script rules here. The three
 * specialists run first only where they genuinely read better than a generic
 * table: kana with its long vowels, hangul with its syllable rules, and hanzi
 * where pinyin-pro segments words instead of gluing syllables together.
 *
 * Kanji are the known gap. Their readings need kuroshiro plus the kuromoji
 * dictionary, which `romanizeLyrics.ts` loads with a top-level await; paying
 * that on a keystroke is not worth it, so a kanji title stays reachable by its
 * kana, its Latin half, or by pasting the kanji itself.
